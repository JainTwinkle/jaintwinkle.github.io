**Abstract**: Speculative execution can significantly improve the performance of Big Data applications by launching other copies of stragglers (slow tasks). Stragglers detection plays an important role in the effectiveness of speculative execution. The methods employed to detect stragglers use the information extracted from the last received heartbeats which may be outdated when triggering detection. This, in turn, can mislead Big Data analytic systems to make wrong detection with high inaccuracy. To shed the light on this issue, we carry out extensive simulations to identify how heartbeat arrival, task starting times, and detection methods impact the accuracy of stragglers detection in Big Data analytic systems. We reveal that the asynchrony in heartbeat arrivals not only lead to marking normal tasks as stragglers (false positives) but can also result in overlooking real stragglers (false negatives).
