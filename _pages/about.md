Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Systems and Networks](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/about/people/?ra=systems-and-networking) group of the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by [Professor Gene Cooperman](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/gene-cooperman/). My research focuses on optimizing limited resources in both compute-centric and data-centric distributed environment. 

<!-- achieving resilience in the High Performance Computing environment via a user-level transparent checkpoint-restore technique. In recent times, I have visited Inria, France as a student, and later as a research visitor, investigating heavy tails on big data platforms in an on-going project. -->
