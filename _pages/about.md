Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Systems and Networks](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/about/people/?ra=systems-and-networking) group of the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by [Professor Gene Cooperman](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/gene-cooperman/). My research focuses on optimizing limited resources in both compute-centric and data-centric distributed environments.

With a forthcoming Ph.D. expected in Summer 2023, I am actively seeking full-time job opportunities in the systems field. Through multiple research internships, I have gained hands-on experience and expertise in both HPC and Big Data platforms.
Please find my [CV](https://jaintwinkle.github.io/files/twinkle_jain_full_cv.pdf) <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> here!

I am passionate about driving innovation and making a tangible impact. Collaborative environments and real-world challenges motivate me to apply my problem-solving skills and analytical mindset.

Explore my website to learn more about my research projects, publications, and experiences. If you are interested in collaborating or discussing exciting job opportunities, please get in touch using the contact information provided.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
